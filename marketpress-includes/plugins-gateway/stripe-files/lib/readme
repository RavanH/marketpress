You will be developing this in multisite context.
                                    
We want to use the Stripe marketplace api to be able to,
(when in multisite) access network settings to configure
instead of main blog. 
like chained, this can be turned on and off 
(still be able to use individually if marketplace setting not turned on).
Then individual substites can do the oath login
 to grant checkout permissions to the main site.
And the main site can configure
what percentage of sales to deduct automatically.

So most all of this is done,
it was just pretty bad UI and buggy as well.

Things to check and fix if needed:

Multisite                                   Single

Network Settings                            Blog settings

On/off (behave like single sites)

                                            oAuth login to stripe
                                                checkout permissions for main blog

%age commission (can be 0)

sandbox and live
API credentials

In multisite it functions identical until
you go to network settings, and configure there for marketplace

Network settings make it simple
to enable marketplace,
enter live and sandbox creds,
configure commissions (or none optionally if 
we just want to use oauth
to simplify setup for substores)

Subsites settings behave nicely if
 there are problems with network settings

Subsites can easily grant permission/signup via oath,
 and super admin can use sandbox mode.

And finally of course that 
everything works fine checkout wise and commission receipt wise.

I'm attaching the latest files from previous trialist,

as well as latest MP plugin version,

and a patch that was recently added and needs applying to this new version.
